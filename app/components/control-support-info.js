    <li>In a 52-week maintenance study (OCTAVE Sustain),
    patients who had completed the induction studies and
    achieved clinical response were rerandomised to
    XELJANZ 10 mg BID, XELJANZ 5 mg BID,<br/> or placebo (1:1:1
    ratio).<sup>1</sup> For patients with loss of response during
    maintenance treatment, a dosage of 10 mg BID may be
    considered and limited to the shortest duration. The
    primary endpoint was remission. Sustained corticosteroid-free remission
    among patients who were in remission at maintenance-trial
    entry was a key secondary endpoint. Patients were permitted to use stable doses
    of oral aminosalicylates, but initiation of corticosteroid
    tapering was required upon entrance to this study for
    patients who were receiving corticosteroids at baseline.
    Concomitant immunosuppressants (immunomodulators
    or biological therapies) were not permitted<sup>1-3</sup></li>
