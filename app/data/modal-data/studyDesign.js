  title: `OCTAVE CLINICAL PROGRAMME TRIAL DESIGN<sup>1&ndash;8</sup>`,
  subtitle: `<strong>Efficacy and safety established in 3 large, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies and an open-label study of patients with moderate to severe UC<sup>7</sup></strong>`,
  bullet1: `<strong>The primary efficacy endpoint in the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials was remission at week 8, and in the OCTAVE Sustain trial, it was remission at week 52<sup>1,2</sup></strong>`,
  bullet2: `The recommended dose for maintenance treatment is XELJANZ 5 mg BID. When induction treatment is complete, the dosage should be decreased from 10 mg BID to 5 mg BID<sup>7</sup>`,
  bullet3: `Patients who completed one of the OCTAVE Induction studies but did not achieve clinical response, or patients who completed or withdrew early due to treatment failure on XELJANZ 5 mg BID or placebo in the maintenance study, were eligible for the open-label extension study. OCTAVE Open is a safety and tolerability study<sup>4,7</sup>`,
  bullet4: `Patients were assessed using the Mayo scale, a tool for evaluating disease activity in patients with UC that is composed of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopic findings, and Physician’s Global Assessment), each with a range of 0 to 3 (higher scores indicate more severe disease)<sup>3,4</sup>`,
  smallText1: `<sup>a</sup>The total number of patients does not include those who received XELJANZ 15 mg BID. There were 16 patients in OCTAVE Induction 1 and 6 patients in OCTAVE Induction 2 receiving XELJANZ 15 mg BID.<sup>8</sup> <strong> 15 mg BID dose is not an approved dose for XELJANZ.<sup>7</sup></strong>  <br/><sup>b</sup>Responders/clinical response was defined as patients with a decrease from induction-trial baseline in the total Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30%, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of ≥1 point or absolute subscore for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1.<sup>1</sup> <br/><sup>c</sup>Treatment failure was defined as an increase in OCTAVE Sustain baseline total Mayo score of ≥3 points, plus an increase in rectal bleeding subscore and endoscopic subscore of ≥1 point and an absolute endoscopic subscore ≥2 after at least 8 weeks of maintenance therapy.<sup>3</sup> <br/><sup>d</sup>Remitters/remission was defined as patients with a total Mayo score ≤2 with no individual subscore >1 <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">and</strong> a rectal bleeding subscore of 0.<sup>3</sup> <br/><sup>e</sup>Efficacy outcomes were assessed in the maintenance remission subpopulation (n=163) and safety was assessed in patients who received ≥1 dose of XELJANZ 5 mg BID in OCTAVE Open (n=175 [163 patients in the maintenance remission subpopulation and 12 patients receiving XELJANZ 5 mg as protocol deviations]).<sup>5</sup> <br/><sup>f</sup>Patients who completed one of the OCTAVE Induction studies (UC-I or UC-II) but did not achieve clinical response.<sup>3</sup>`,
