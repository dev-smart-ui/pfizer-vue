  title: `XELJANZ SAFETY PROFILE IN UC`,
  subtitle: `<strong>The safety profile for XELJANZ was studied across 3 large placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials (2 induction and 1 maintenance) that included 1139 patients with moderate to severe UC, and an open-label safety and tolerability study<sup>1,2</sup></strong>`,
  attention: `XELJANZ offers nearly 8 years of long-term safety data in UC (median exposure: 1.7 years)<sup>3,a</sup>`,
  adverseReactions: `Adverse reactions`,
  adverseReactionsBullet: `In the induction and maintenance studies, the most common types of serious adverse reactions were gastrointestinal disorders and infections, and the most common serious adverse reaction was worsening of UC<sup>1</sup>`,
  usePatients: `Use in patients over 65 years of age`,
  usePatientsBullet: `Considering the increased risk of serious infections, MI, and malignancies with XELJANZ in patients over 65 years of age, XELJANZ should only be used in these patients if no suitable treatment alternatives are available<sup>1</sup>`,
  hepaticImpairment: "Hepatic impairment",
  hepaticImpairmentBullet: `Use of XELJANZ in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended<sup>1</sup>`,
  usePregnancy: "Use in pregnancy",
  usePregnancyBullet1: `There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of XELJANZ in pregnant women. As a precautionary measure, the use of XELJANZ in pregnant women is contraindicated<sup>1</sup>`,
  usePregnancyBullet2: `Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with XELJANZ and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose<sup>1</sup>`,
  VTE: "VTE",
  VTE_Bullet1: `Serious VTE events, including PE (some of which were fatal) and DVT, have been observed in patients taking XELJANZ<sup>1</sup>`,
  VTE_Bullet2: `A dose-dependent increased risk for VTE was observed in a large, ongoing post-marketing safety study of patients with RA who were aged 50 and older with at least one CV risk factor and treated with XELJANZ 10 mg BID vs XELJANZ 5 mg BID or TNFis. The majority of these events were serious and some resulted in death<sup>1</sup>`,
  attention2: `XELJANZ 10 mg BID for maintenance treatment is not recommended in patients with UC who have known VTE risk factors,<sup>d</sup> unless there is no suitable alternative treatment available<sup>1</sup>`,
  limitations: "Limitations of overall cohort and OLE data",
  limitationsBullet1: `Pooled, post hoc analysis of studies from the UC clinical trial programme are subject to certain limitations. First, unlike ORAL Surveillance, the patient population is not limited to a high-risk population but includes all enrolled patients. Second, endpoints of interest (such as MACE and malignancy for ORAL Surveillance) were not specifically defined and adjudicated. Additionally, ORAL Surveillance was a long-term safety study (vs shorter term and designed to test efficacy). Resultant incidence rates in ORAL Surveillance differed from rates seen from pooled study data, suggesting the pooled data may be obscuring information about predictors of events given adverse rates may differ from one patient population to another and may change over time`,
  limitationsBullet2: `OLE studies may provide useful data; however, conduct of OLE studies where both treatment and dose are known to both investigator and patient is subject to certain biases and limitations`,
  limitationsBullet3: `Biases include, but are not limited to, patient selection (patient willingness or ineligibility to enroll, which may be due to a prior serious AE), prior treatment, volunteer, observer, initial dose or study drug, investigator/patient expectation and study duration. Limitations include, but are not limited to, AE frequencies and incidence rates subject to change over time due to patient entry/exit, dose changes influenced by both investigator and patient, dose restrictions in certain countries, the number of patients and exposure for a specific safety event possibly differing depending on the timing of censored events, and the number of observed patients with longer exposure times becoming lower`,
  dataSources: `Other data sources in UC`,
  dataSourcesBullet1: `It is important to note that the XELJANZ clinical study programme in UC was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XELJANZ in adult patients with moderate to severe UC, and was not specifically designed to assess MACE and malignancy as specific endpoints. Furthermore, the data from the XELJANZ clinical study programme in UC were collected over various time periods (ie, when the studies were conducted as well as study-specific follow-up periods), across varied geographies, and using a variety of analysis methods`,
  dataSourcesBullet2: `The XELJANZ clinical study programme in UC was not conducted among a population which was enriched for CV risk, as was the case with ORAL Surveillance`,
  dataSourcesBullet3: `Given these data are from different study populations, have different study designs, and were not designed to assess the specific endpoints of MACE and malignancy, comparative conclusions are inappropriate and, therefore, should not be drawn from this content`,
