<sup>b</sup>Limitations: this is a post hoc analysis of data from an OLE study of XELJANZ in a subpopulation of patients with moderate-to-severe UC meeting remission criteria following completion of the 52-week OCTAVE Sustain study.
<sup>1</sup> OLE studies have inherent biases. For this analysis from the OLE study, treatment and dose were known to investigator and patient, there was no comparator arm, and the sample size was small.
<sup>1</sup> This analysis should be interpreted with caution while taking these considerations into account.
