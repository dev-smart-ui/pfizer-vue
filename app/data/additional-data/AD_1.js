<sup>e</sup> in OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2: daily bowel movement data were collected from patients to calculate the Mayo stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores. For post hoc analyses, baseline values for Mayo subscores were derived using average data from 3 of the 5 days before first dose. Change from baseline was determined based on diary data for each day during the first 15 days of therapy

<br/> <sup>e</sup>Limitations of post hoc analysis: these analyses were post hoc, and data were based on daily telephone diary entries. Onset of XELJANZ efficacy in the wider population of patients with UC may differ. XELJANZ plasma concentration may not be at steady state until 24 to 48 hours after initial dosing; therefore, these analyses should be interpreted with caution. <sup>3,4</sup>
