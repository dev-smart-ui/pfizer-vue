  bullet3: `In a 52-week maintenance study (OCTAVE Sustain), patients who had completed the induction studies and achieved clinical response were 
<br/> re-randomised to XELJANZ 10 mg BID, XELJANZ 5 mg BID, or placebo (1:1:1 ratio). For patients with loss of response during maintenance treatment with 5 mg BID, a dosage of 10 mg BID may be considered and limited to the shortest duration.
<sup>1</sup> The primary endpoint was remission. Sustained corticosteroid-free remission among patients who were in remission at maintenance-trial entry was a key secondary endpoint. Patients were permitted to use stable doses of oral aminosalicylates, but initiation of corticosteroid tapering was required upon entrance to this study for patients who were receiving corticosteroids at baseline. Concomitant immunosuppressants (immunomodulators or biological therapies) were not permitted

  smallText: `<strong>Maintenance treatment with XELJANZ 10 mg BID should be limited to patients who are not at increased risk for VTE, who experience a decrease in response on XELJANZ 5 mg BID, or who fail to respond to alternative treatment options (eg, TNFi therapy). XELJANZ 10 mg BID for maintenance treatment should be used for the shortest duration possible. The lowest effective dose needed to maintain response should be used.
