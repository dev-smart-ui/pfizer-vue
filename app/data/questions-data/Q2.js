    title: 'Among patients in remission at maintenance baseline, what proportion of patients with UC on XELJANZ 5 mg BID achieved sustained steroid-free remission through week 52?',
    shortInfo: 'BID, twice daily; UC, ulcerative colitis.',
    baseDescription: `
<strong>Maintenance treatment with XELJANZ 10 mg BID should be limited to patients who are not at increased risk for VTE, who experience a decrease in response on XELJANZ 5 mg BID, or who fail to respond to alternative treatment options <br/> (eg, TNFi therapy). XELJANZ 10 mg BID for maintenance treatment should be used for the shortest duration possible. The lowest effective dose needed to maintain response should be used.<sup>3</sup></strong>
<br/><sup>a</sup>Remission (primary endpoint) was defined as a total Mayo score ≤2 with no individual subscore >1 and rectal bleeding subscore of 0.<sup>4</sup>
<br/><sup>b</sup>Includes all patients, without and with prior TNFi failure.<sup>2</sup>
<br/><sup>c</sup>Sustained steroid-free remission was defined as being in remission and on no corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks prior to the visit at both week 24 and week 52 among those in remission at maintenance baseline.<sup>1,4</sup>
<br/>BID, twice daily; TNFi, tumour necrosis factor inhibitor; UC, ulcerative colitis; VTE, venous thromboembolism.

    <li>In a 52-week maintenance study (OCTAVE Sustain),
    patients who had completed the induction studies and
    achieved clinical response were rerandomised to
    XELJANZ 10 mg BID, XELJANZ 5 mg BID,<br/> or placebo (1:1:1
    ratio).<sup>1</sup> For patients with loss of response during
    maintenance treatment, a dosage of 10 mg BID may be
    considered and limited to the shortest duration. The
    primary endpoint was remission. Sustained corticosteroid-free remission
    among patients who were in remission at maintenance-trial
    entry was a key secondary endpoint. Patients were permitted to use stable doses
    of oral aminosalicylates, but initiation of corticosteroid
    tapering was required upon entrance to this study for
    patients who were receiving corticosteroids at baseline.
    Concomitant immunosuppressants (immunomodulators
    or biological therapies) were not permitted<sup>1-3</sup></li>
