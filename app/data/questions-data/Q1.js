    title: 'How rapid was the onset of XELJANZ in significantly reducing stool frequency and rectal bleeding in patients with UC in phase 3 induction studies?',
    shortInfo: 'UC, ulcerative colitis.',
    baseDescription: `
<sup>a</sup>Remission (primary endpoint) was defined as a total Mayo score ≤2 with no individual subscore >1 and rectal bleeding subscore of 0.<sup>2</sup> 
<br/><sup>b</sup>Includes all patients, TNFi naïve and TNFi exposed.<sup>2</sup> 
<br/><sup>c</sup>Proportion of patients with a reduction from baseline Mayo stool frequency subscore of ≥1 point excludes patients with a baseline Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0.<sup>3</sup> 
<br/><sup>d</sup>Proportion of patients with a reduction from baseline Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point excludes patients with a baseline Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0.<sup>3</sup> 
<br/><sup>e</sup>Limitations of post hoc analysis: these analyses were post hoc, and data were based on daily telephone diary entries. Onset of XELJANZ efficacy in the wider population of patients with UC may differ. XELJANZ plasma concentration may not be at steady state until 24 to 48 hours after initial dosing; therefore, these analyses should be interpreted with caution.<sup>3,4</sup>
<br/>BID, twice daily; TNFi, tumour necrosis factor inhibitor; UC, ulcerative colitis.
