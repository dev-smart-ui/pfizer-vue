    title: 'Among patients in remission at maintenance baseline, what proportion of patients with UC on XELJANZ 5 mg BID achieved sustained steroid-free remission through week 52?',
    shortInfo: 'BID, twice daily; UC, ulcerative colitis.',
    baseDescription: `
<strong>Maintenance treatment with XELJANZ 10 mg BID should be limited to patients who are not at increased risk for VTE, who experience a decrease in response on XELJANZ 5 mg BID, or who fail to respond to alternative treatment options <br/> (eg, TNFi therapy). XELJANZ 10 mg BID for maintenance treatment should be used for the shortest duration possible. The lowest effective dose needed to maintain response should be used.<sup>3</sup></strong>
<br/><sup>a</sup>Remission (primary endpoint) was defined as a total Mayo score ≤2 with no individual subscore >1 and rectal bleeding subscore of 0.<sup>4</sup>
<br/><sup>b</sup>Includes all patients, without and with prior TNFi failure.<sup>2</sup>
<br/><sup>c</sup>Sustained steroid-free remission was defined as being in remission and on no corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks prior to the visit at both week 24 and week 52 among those in remission at maintenance baseline.<sup>1,4</sup>
<br/>BID, twice daily; TNFi, tumour necrosis factor inhibitor; UC, ulcerative colitis; VTE, venous thromboembolism.
