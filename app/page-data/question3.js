    shortInfo: 'UC, ulcerative colitis.',
    baseDescription: `
<sup>a</sup>Limitations of the analysis include the shorter exposure time and relatively small XELJANZ treatment groups in patients with UC compared with the larger safety database available for RA. This limits the precision and interpretation of the IRs determined for events with long latency, that is, malignancies.<sup>2</sup> An additional limitation is the source data from the OLE study. Open-label studies have inherent biases. Treatment and dose were known to investigator and patient; there was no comparator arm and the sample size was small. This analysis should be interpreted with caution while taking these considerations into account.<sup>3</sup>
<br/>AE, adverse event; BID, twice daily; IR, incidence rate; MACE, major adverse cardiovascular event; OI, opportunistic infection; OLE, open-label extension; PY, patient-year;
RA, rheumatoid arthritis; 
UC, ulcerative colitis.

    <li>Across the XELJANZ clinical trial programme, XELJANZ offers up to      7.8 years of long-term safety data in UC (median exposure: 1.7 years)<sup>1,a</sup></li>
    <li>Cohorts analysed were: phase 3 maintenance<br/> (592 patients receiving placebo, XELJANZ 5 mg, or 10 mg BID) and overall (1157 patients receiving XELJANZ 5 mg or 10 mg BID in phase 2/phase 3/OLE studies). Proportions and IRs (unique patients with events per 100 PY of exposure) were evaluated for AEs of special interest. OIs, malignancies, MACE, and gastrointestinal perforations were adjudicated<sup>1</sup></li>
